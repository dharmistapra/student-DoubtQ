                                DoubtQ will send all notifications and receipts to the email address you
                                provided at account creation or as updated. DoubtQ offers the convenience
                                of sending you text message reminders if you so want. Our mobile text
                                message disclaimers are included in these Terms of Service and should
                                be read carefully. In order to deliver the Services, DoubtQ may use the
                                phone numbers you supply to DoubtQ, including your wireless number, to
                                call you, including by automated or prerecorded message, to remind you
                                that rental books are due back. Whether or whether you get reminders by
                                email, text, or any other means, you are still responsible for
                                complying with the Terms of Use, including, for example, the timely
                                return of your books. DoubtQ will never contact you through email or
                                text message to request sensitive information such as your login,
                                password, or payment details. If you get a suspicious email or text
                                message that seems to be from DoubtQ, please delete it immediately.

                                There may be more than one proper way to solve a given issue; if you
                                provide the method(s) you'd want to use, we'll use those; if you don't,
                                we'll use our best judgment, which may result in a solution that differs
                                from what you had in mind. The fee will be discussed after an inquiry
                                has been received. We promise to provide the answers by the due date if
                                you pay in advance. You may ask a few clarifying questions to ensure
                                that you fully grasp the solution's structure. Although we strive to
                                be available 24/7, there may be instances when we just cannot. To ensure

                                    Validation: To guarantee users can make payments to DoubtQ, DoubtQ may
                                    ask users to present a legitimate means of payment (e.g., credit or
                                    debit card, PayPal account, etc.) related to a financial institution
                                    when they register for an account or buy items or services. Your
                                    DoubtQ account must always have a valid payment method if one is
                                    necessary (either the original method of payment or a replacement).
                                    DoubtQ may charge your account "pending" to verify your payment
                                    method. This charge will not be verified and will vanish from your
                                    financial statement (usually within seven days - check with your
                                    financial institution for additional information). Please note that
                                    this pending charge may be generated if you alter your payment
                                    details or make an unprocessed transaction.

                                    Authorization Holds: For book rentals, we may approve expected charges
                                    and taxes from your payment method. The transaction and payment method
                                    will determine the authorization amount. These money may be on
                                    authorization hold. We may automatically request further authorization
                                    holds if costs exceed the authorization hold. You agree that we may
                                    charge any alternative means of payment we have on file if your
                                    payment provider refuses any permission (without notice to you,
                                    unless required by applicable law). If the costs do not exceed the
                                    amount due after a transaction, your payment method provider will
                                    release the authorization for the amount not used. Your bank's
                                    authorization hold removal timing will vary. You must ensure that
                                    the payment method has adequate money before processing any transaction.

                                Sometimes, DoubtQ may provide credit to you in the form of "DoubtQ Credit."
                                To the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, DoubtQ may impose
                                restrictions on your use of DoubtQ Credit and you may not transfer
                                DoubtQ Credit from one DoubtQ Service to another once it has been issued
                                . Your credit will never expire if it was issued in compensation for
                                services rendered or as a refund, but we reserve the right to convert
                                it to cash and give you the proceeds upon notification after a certain
                                length of time has passed. You may exchange the credit for cash if the
                                original conditions of the credit grant allowed for such a redemption.
                                Support credits are not transferable and cannot be used to purchase more
                                time with the service.

                                DoubtQ may sometimes provide promotional incentives such as price
                                reductions, bonuses, coupons, loyalty programs, point systems, giveaways,
                                and competitions. It's common for these incentives to come with their
                                own set of requirements and limits (e.g., limiting when, how often, and
                                under what circumstances you may be eligible for the promotion). It is
                                your responsibility to familiarize yourself with and abide by any such
                                regulations, prohibitions, and limits. You also undertake not to cheat
                                or defraud the system in any way by engaging in self-dealing, collusion,
                                smurfing (divide big orders or sales transactions into several individual
                                transactions to gain multiple discounts or payments), or any other
                                similar behavior. Your participation in such promotions signifies your
                                acceptance of these rules and limits, and your understanding that DoubtQ,
                                in its sole discretion, may refuse payment or benefits to the maximum
                                extent authorized by law (e.g., when it believes improper activity has
                                occurred or when a code has expired). Any and all offers are subject
                                to termination without prior notification. Rental or purchase
                                discounts only apply to the basic price of the item or service,
                                not to taxes, shipping costs, late fees, or any other extra charges
                                (e.g., conversion to purchase fees).

                                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
                                    industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
                                    ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                                    only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                                    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
